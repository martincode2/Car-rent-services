Afer to download Ziped file and unzped or to clone your pository url from your Vscode edit, 

The first of all, open vscode new terminal and start db.sjon server port 3000 used this command 
# json-server --port 3000 db.json

The second open other other new tab terminal and start db.json server port 7000 with this command 
# cd dbjson> json-server --port 7000 db.json

Then After all above, open other new terminal you, write
# npm start 

The end, if an application doesn't running and stop to run, you can start vscode server with,
# npm start 

Thank you!
